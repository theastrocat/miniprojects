# Project To Do EDA On Scientific Journal Articles


*Current Number Of Articles:* 10,519


After reading [Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/), by Alex Reinhart, I was compelled to explore the verbiage and depth at which scientific articles present their findings. This is my attempt at using NLP and some data analysis to look at how findings are presented to the reader.

### The Data:
The first order of business is to find some data. Luckily there are some wonderful free resources of journal articles out there that I was able to scrape for a few days (script found [here](https://github.com/theastrocat/miniprojects/blob/master/journal_articles/article_scrape.py)).
